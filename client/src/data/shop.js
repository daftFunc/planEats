      "PreparationFor spice rub:                                        Combine all ingredients in small bowl.                                                                            Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.                                    For chimichurri sauce:                                        Combine first 8 ingredients in blender; blend until almost smooth. Add 1/4 of parsley, 1/4 of cilantro, and 1/4 of mint; blend until incorporated. Add remaining herbs in 3 more additions, pureeing until almost smooth after each addition.                                                                            Do ahead: Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.                                    For beef tenderloin:                                        Let beef stand at room temperature 1 hour.                                                                            Prepare barbecue (high heat). Pat beef dry with paper towels; brush with oil. Sprinkle all over with spice rub, using all of mixture (coating will be thick). Place beef on grill; sear 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium-high. Grill uncovered until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of beef registers 130F for medium-rare, moving beef to cooler part of grill as needed to prevent burning, and turning occasionally, about 40 minutes. Transfer to platter; cover loosely with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice beef crosswise. Serve with chimichurri sauce.                                                                            *Available at specialty foods stores and from tienda.com."

      "Fire up a gass or charcoal grill or indoor grill pan. Brush the mushroom caps with olive oil and season with salt. Grill over medium-high heat until soft and nicely browned, about 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside under foil. Brush the onion slices with the oil and season with salt. Grill over medium-high heat until charred and soft, about 3 minutes. Set aside under foil.Grill the burger buns until toasty, about 2 minutes. When ready to serve, return the mushrooms to the grill over medium-low heat and top with the cheese slices. Cover with the hood so the cheese can melt. Alternatively, if cooking indoors, place the mushrooms on a baking sheet and melt cheese under the broiler for 1 minutes. Assemble the burgers: Slather the romesco sauce on both buns, top the bottom half with the mushroom cap, followed by the arugula. Sandwich together and serve with the remaining sauce on the side.",

    instructions:
      "Preheat the oven to 375.Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Do not add any salt.Add the beluga lentils to the boiling water, let cook for 5 minutes, and then simmer for 10-15 minutes. When the lentils are tender, drain the excess water and rinse the lentils until the water runs clear. Set aside.Combine the ground flax with the warm water and let sit for 10 minutes.Puree the lentils with 1 can of the black beans. Pour into a large bowl with the remaining black beans, quinoa, oat flour, garlic, red onion, red pepper, walnuts, flax egg, and spices. Taste the mixture and adjust the spices to your liking.Refrigerate the mixture for 1 hour. This isn't necessary, but will make your life a lot easier as you form the patties.To form the patties, grab a handful of the patty mixture and form it into a ball. It will be a bit sticky, but don't fret. Drop onto a parchment-lined sheet, and press down lightly with your fingers to flatten. Repeat with remaining mixture, to form a total of 11 patties. Bake for 12 minutes on one side, flip carefully with a spatula, and bake on the other side for another 12 minutes.Optional - pan fry each patty in a bit of oil to crispen the outside of the burger. I haven't tried this yet, because they're pretty great the way they are.While the patties are baking, combine the red peppers, sour cream, Greek yogurt, salt, and cayenne in a food processor. Pulse until smooth, then pour in the oil with the processor running. Set aside until the burgers are ready.",

    instructions:
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over a medium-high flame. Saute the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, curry powder, turmeric, zucchini, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Continue to saute until the zucchini is soft, another 3 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a medium food processor, pulse the chickpeas, lentils, Dijon, lime juice, cilantro, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until coarsely pureed. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the lentil mixture, quinoa, and zucchini mixture. Taste for seasoning and add more salt as necessary. Form the mixture into heaping 1/2-cup sized patties. Arrange on a plate and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, or overnight. In a large non-stick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. Cook the veggie burgers, flattening them with the back of your spatula on the first side, for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Remove to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Then serve open-faced or inside burger buns.",

      "(If baking the burgers, preheat oven to 200C/400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper)Make the mole sauce first.In a medium-sized pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for approx 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic, sugar and spices and continue to cook for a further minute. Add the remaining ingredients, bring to a simmer and cook on low for 10-15 minutes. Blend using an immersion blender and set aside.For the burgers, in a food processor, blend the black beans, 1/4 C mole sauce, green onions, spices and salt until you have a chunky pure. Pulse in the oats and finally stir through the diced pepper.For 4 large burgers, use a 1/3 C measuring cup to divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and flatten into thick patties.Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook the burgers for approx 6-8 minutes on each side, or until brown. Alternatively, place the patties on the prepared baking sheet and bake for approx 30 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.Serve burgers topped with the remaining mole sauce and sliced avocado (essentials!) plus your favourite burger toppings- vegan sour cream, sliced tomato, onion, etc.",

      "burgersPlace the beef in a bowl and season with the salt and pepper. Mix with your hands to incorporate, forming 4 to 6 patties, whichever size you wish and whatever size fits your bun. Heat a large skillet (or thegrill, your preference) over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. Cook the patties until browned on both sides and your desired doneness is reached. I do about 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-well, but it will depend on how think your burgers are.In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, cilantro and lime juiced, stirring well. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.To assemble your burgers, cover the bottom bun with avocado slices. Place the burger on top and drizzle on lots of queso cheese. Top with the pico and the jalapeos. Serve immediately.queso cheeseHeat a saucepan over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. Stir in the onions and garlic. Season with the salt and pepper. Cook until the onion softens, about 5 to 6 minutes. Slowly stream in 3/4 cup of the half and half, whisking the entire time. Toss the grated cheese with 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch. In a bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup half and half and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until no lumps remain to create a slurry. Stir the slurry into the saucepan and cook for a minute until the milk thickens. Reduce the heat to low.Stir in the grated cheese, one small handful at a time, until melted. Transfer the mixture to a crock, larger bowl or a small crockpot heating on low. Spoon on the burgers and serve the extra with chips!",

    instructions:
      "Preheat the oven to 350F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.Peel the sweet potato. Using a box grater with the regular-sized grate holes, grate 1.5 cups of sweet potato. Place in large bowl. I had about 1/2 of the sweet potato leftover, so I sliced it into 1-cm rounds and placed it on the baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and toss to coat.In a large bowl, stir together the grated sweet potato, cilantro, basil, garlic, ginger, and chopped peanuts.In a food processor, add the oats and process until finely chopped. You want the texture to be like a coarse flour. Stir the oat flour into the bowl with the vegetables.Now add the drained chickpeas into the processor and process until finely chopped. You want the mixture to be a cross between a coarse paste and finely chopped chickpeas, but don't completely puree the chickpeas. Stir the processed chickpeas into the bowl with the vegetables and oat flour.In a mug, whisk together the ground flax and water. Let it sit for only 20 seconds or so, any longer and it will get too thick. Stir this flax egg into the vegetable chickpea mixture until fully combined.Stir in the sesame oil, tamari, lime juice, coriander, salt, and pepper all to taste.Shape the mixture into 6-8 patties, packing each patty tightly between your hands so it holds together well. Place each patty onto the prepared baking sheet along with the sweet potato rounds.Bake for 20 minutes, then gently flip the patties and potato rounds and bake for another 15-17 minutes until golden on both sides. You might have to remove the sweet potato a bit early - just keep an eye on them so they don't burn.While the burgers are baking, prepare the peanut sauce. Add all sauce ingredients into a food processor and process until smooth. Adjust ingredients to taste if desired. The sauce will thicken up as it sits.After baking, place patties on a cooling rack for 10 minutes to cool slightly. Serve with toasted buns (or lettuce or whole grain wraps), tomato slices, roasted sweet potato, lettuce, and the peanut sauce.The peanut sauce will store in the fridge for at least a week. The burgers can be frozen (after baking and cooling) for a couple weeks.",
